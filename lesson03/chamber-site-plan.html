      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Site Name</h3>
      <p>
        Maracaibo Chamber of Commerce
      </p>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The Maracaibo Chamber of Commerce helps promoting business interests 
        of the members of the organization and promote the area, attracting additional business, tourism, 
        and people. 

        We aim to act as a regional economic catalyst, leadership convener and community champion that 
        vouches for its economic growth.
      </p>

      <h3>Scenarios</h3>
      <p>
        A President/CEO of a company from another city wants to create communications and build relationships with 
        the Maracaibo chamber of commerce to propose collaborations that could benefit both cities and help expand 
        businesses and give birth to new opportunities for future collaborations. So he might need to know what the 
        Maracaibo chamber of commerce looks like, their members, and general contact information to possibly
        arrange meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        A small business owner wants to see if they could get help from the chamber of commerce to meet with other
        local business owners and provide sources to grow his network. As well as maybe have their business presented 
        in a positive light to the community. He might need the contact information of the member that handles communications
        between local businesses, and would probably also like to know how to plan meetings or take part into events.
      </p>
      <p>
        A local resident wishes to revitalize the part of the city where he lives. He might need to know which members of 
        the chamber of commerce he should talk to inform investors of possible businesses that could create new jobs
        and advertisements that promote it and attract people.
